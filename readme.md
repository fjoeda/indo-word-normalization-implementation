# Indonesian Word Normalization Implementation

## Overview
This repo contains the implementation of word normalization using character-level seq2seq approach.
The transformer arcitecture from Vaswani et.al. (2017) is implemented on Colloquial Indonesian Lexicon from Salsabila et.al. (2018) and IndoCollex dataset from Wibowo et.al. (2021).
The dataset is taken from those sources then transformed into json files containing the informal-formal word pairs. The dataset containing those combined sources are also created.
Since the Colloquial Indonesian Lexicon only contains one file, the dataset is splitted into train, valid, test set with 80:10:10 proportion. 

## Running Script

```bash:
 python run_experiment.py --dataset_name <dataset_name> --num_epoch 200 --config_name <config_name> --model_name <output_model_name>
```

The `dataset_name` parameters can be filled with this following inputs
- `indocollex` for IndoCollex dataset
- `col_id_norm` for Colloquial Indonesian Lexicon dataset
- `combined` for combined dataset from IndoCollex and Colloquial Indonesian Lexicon

The `config_name` can be filled using the file name from the `./config` folder. The config folder contains configuration for the transformers architecture from
- The original "Attention is All You Need" paper form Vaswani et.al. (2017)
- The 'smaller transformer' implemented by Wu et.al. (2021) on "Applying the Transformer to Character-level Transduction" with different dropout value
